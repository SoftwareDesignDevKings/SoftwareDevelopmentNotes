## üöÄüöÄ  Welcome üöÄüöÄ

The software design and development notes repository is used to store notes regarding the SDD course.
It is also used as a guide and learning environment for using Git and GitHub.
There are some rules when committing to this repository, and they should be followed, otherwise,
your notes will not be merged into the main reposititory.

## Using Git with Notes

Git and GitHub allow you download, update, and make changes to the notes which are on the 
repository. As mentioned, above there are processes and rules when using this repository. 
The common commands and the rules are listed below:

### Git commands

üî¥ `git clone <repo>`   ‚û°Ô∏è allows you to clone a new repository. So long as you have access.  
üî¥ `git fetch --all`    ‚û°Ô∏è makes git aware of changes in all of your repositories, remote or local.  
üî¥ `git pull`            Ô∏è will download changes from the online repositor.  
üî¥ `git branch <name>`  ‚û°Ô∏è creates a new branch to keep changes separate.  
üî¥ `git merge <branch>` ‚û°Ô∏è move changes from one branch to another.  
üî¥ `git push`           ‚û°Ô∏è push changes to the remote repository.  

### Rules

When using git to commit notes to the repository, there are special considerations you must make. There may be multiple people editing the repositiory, so it is good Git ettiqutee to make sure you pull, and push in a clean manner.  
To achieve this, these are the simple rules to follow:  

### **Rules to follow**

1. If you don't have a copy of the repository, clone it into a new directory. Somewhere you are able to edit it effectivly.
2. Make sure you `git fetch --all` before you edit any files. This will inform you of all changes. 
3. If there are changes, make sure you pull the latest version from the repository. 
4. When pulling from the repo, use the `git pull --all` command. It will pull changes for all repositories. 
5. Make sure you make a new branch before you make any changes. **No changes will be allowed to be committed to the MAIN branch.** 
6. Commit your code regularly. Make sure you make a commit using `git commit` before you change files, or after each time you save a file. 

Once you have finished your changes. You can make a _**Pull Request**_. Which allows you to merge your changes to the **MAIN** branch.
