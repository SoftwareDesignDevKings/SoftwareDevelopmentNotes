## Structured approach

The structured approach is characterised by distinct formal stages:

- Defining and understanding the problem
- Planning and designing
- Implementing
- Testing and evaluating
- Maintaining

Each stage must be fully completed before the next can begin. This is necessary as teams of developers with varying skills and responsibilities are involved in the development process.
