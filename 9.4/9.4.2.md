## 9.4.2 Option 2 The interrelationship between software and hardware

This topic looks in much more depth at how software uses hardware to achieve the desired
outcomes. In Section 9.2.3 Implementation of Software Solutions students are introduced to how
instructions are processed by the CPU.

In this topic students are shown how data is stored in binary format. Students investigate further
how the basic arithmetic processes and storage of data are performed by electronic circuitry.
Students should recognise that the design of such circuitry follows the same cyclic process as the
design of software â€“ once the problem has been identified, an appropriate solution is designed and
tested. A completed circuit can be modified to meet changing requirements and all solutions should
be documented and subsequently evaluated.

This topic also introduces students to data streams and their use in communication between the
CPU and a range of hardware devices.

**Outcomes**  
A Student:  
- H1.1: Explains the interrelationship between hardware and software  
- H1.3: Describes how the major components of a computer system store and manipulate data    
- H2.2: Explains the interrelationship between emerging technologies and software development  
- H4.1: Identifies needs to which software solutions are appropriate  
- H5.2: Creates and justifies the need for the various types of documentation required for a software solution
- H5.3: Selects and applies appropriate software to facilitate the design and development of software solutions
