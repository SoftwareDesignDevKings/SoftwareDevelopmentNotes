9.4.1 Option 1 Programming Paradigms   

- This topic offers students the opportunity to look at different types of programming languages. 

Each of these was developed in an attempt to improve programmer productivity. By focusing on 
each of the different paradigms, students should gain an insight into how effective each approach
has been, together with an understanding of the specific areas where the use of a particular
paradigm could be particularly appropriate. This understanding will broaden the studentsâ€™
experience of different paradigms and will also offer them a wider choice from which to select an
appropriate language to solve a specific problem.
Students are expected to implement solutions to a number of small relevant problems using an
appropriate language. A range of problems should be selected. Some problems will require the use
of the logic paradigm, while other problems will require the use of the object oriented paradigm.
Outcomes

H1.2 differentiates between various methods used to construct software solutions
H2.1 explains the implications of the development of different languages
H2.2 explains the interrelationship between emerging technologies and software development
H4.1 identifies needs to which software solutions are appropriate
H4.2 applies appropriate development methods to solve software problems
H5.3 selects and applies appropriate software to facilitate the design and development of software
solutions.
