In order for students to be able to develop software to meet an identified need, they first need to be 
able to understand the specifications of a problem so that they can eventually translate these 
specifications into code. 
As well as having good technical skills, it is necessary for students to have good communication 
skills so that the usersâ€™ requirements can be fully understood and implemented throughout the 
development process. The modelling tools used should conform to those specified in the Software 
and Course Specifications document and should provide documentation that can be interpreted by 
developers and maintainers. Students should develop and refine skills as an integrated part of 
developing their software solutions. It is important at this initial stage of the process that all relevant 
social and ethical issues are considered as an integral part of the design and development of the 
solution.
Outcomes
A student:
H1.2 differentiates between various methods used to construct software solutions 
H3.1 identifies and evaluates legal, social and ethical issues in a number of contexts 
H3.2 constructs software solutions that address legal, social and ethical issues
H4.1 identifies needs to which software solutions are appropriate
H4.2 applies appropriate development methods to solve software problems 
H4.3 applies a modular approach to implement well structured software solutions and evaluates 
their effectiveness
H5.1 applies project management techniques to maximise the productivity of the software 
development
H5.2 creates and justifies the need for the various types of documentation required for a software 
solution
H5.3 selects and applies appropriate software to facilitate the design and development of software 
solutions
H6.1 assesses the skills required in the software development cycle
H6.2 communicates the processes involved in a software solution to an inexperienced user 
H6.3 uses and describes a collaborative approach during the software development cycle
H6.4 develops and evaluates effective user interfaces, in consultation with appropriate people.
