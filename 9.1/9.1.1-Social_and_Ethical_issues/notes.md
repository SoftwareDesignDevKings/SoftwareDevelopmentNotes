# 1.1 Social and Ethical Issues

## The Impact of Software

### Inappropriate data structures, for example the year 2000 problem

- in the 1960s and 1970s storage was expensive so software wAs required to use the absolute minimum amount of storage space
- to cater to this need, software developers often used only 2 digits to represent the year within dates. it was never envisaged that these products would still be in use when the year 2000 came along
- as a consequence of this short-sightedness it was anticipated that many computer-based systems would fail as the year changed from the 1999 to 2000. that is, the software would potentially think that the year was 1900 and not 2000
- similar problems were expected with regard to other years, such as 1960 being interpreted as 2060 and hence causing a variety of incorrect calculations and computer crashes

### Computer malware such as viruses

- malware or malicious software includes any software which performs an unwanted and uninvited task
- examples of malware include viruses, worms, trojan horses and spyware
- viruses are commonly attached or embedded within apparently legitimate software or files. as the software is executed the virus is also able to execute, duplicate itself and perform its malicious processing
- worms are a type of virus which aims to slow down a system. many worms exploit a security flaw in the operating system and then install themselves on the hard drive
- a trojan horse is malicious software that is masquerading as legitimate software. for instance, you may think you’re downloading a game, however when the game is executed it begins to perform unwanted processes, such as deleting or corrupting files
- spyware aims to obtain your information without your knowledge. some spyware is able to capture your web browsing habits, read your emails contacts or even read keystrokes as your enter passwords and credit card details

Social Networking

- A social network is simply a group of people who associate with each other
- A social networking site is an online, virtual community where people share their thoughts and activities with family, friends or those with similar interests
- social networking sites have many varied and worthwhile advantages, however there are also disadvantages:
    - private and personal information is all too easily shared and this can led

Cyber Safety

- the online world of the internet includes a variety of different dangers and security issues. all internet connected devices have risks, this includes laptops, mobile phones and even game consoles
- cyber safety is about minimising the risk of such dangers, particularly for children
- although security software and firewalls cam assist in this regard, many online issues are unable to be dealt with using software alone
- cyber safety is about protecting yourself when online
- to be cyber safe means observing recommended practices and procedures to protect your personal information when using the internet
- recommendations regarding cyber safety include:
    - location-based services
    - unwanted contact
    - cyberbullying
    - online friends
    - your digital footprint
    - online purchasing
    - identity theft
    

### Rights and Responsibilities of Software Developers

**Acknowledging the intellectual property of others / Recognition by others of the developer’s intellectual property**

- Different contributors to a software product will have differing requirements in regard to their intellectual property.
- Royalty is compensation, usually a portion of proceeds paid to the owner (author) of a right, for the use of a work.
- The particular details of how royalties are to be distributed should be detailed in a contract.
- Publishers of software products have a responsibility to ensure the intellectual property rights of all authors involved in the creation of the final product are acknowledged and compensated, as the law requires.

producing quality software solutions

- the final quality of a software development project is an important responsibility for all software developers
- quality software is developed as a result of thorough planning and testing
- quality assurance (QA) is an ongoing process throughout the design and development to ensure and verify the quality of the software
- customers perceive quality according to their expectations about the software product
    - if the customers expectations are exceeded, then they will perceive the product to be one of high quality
    - if the product fails the customer’s expectation then the product is perceived to be of low quality
- Apart from the design and development process there are other external factors, which need to be considered by developers to maximise the quality and reliability of their products. Such factors include:
    - Hardware - Due to the vast array of hardware devices available from different manufacturers and with different specifications.
    - Operating System - Developers of software expect the operating system to be reliable and robust.
    - Other software - Software already installed, or that could be installed in the future, can affect the perceived quality of a developer’s product.
    - Runtime errors - All applications developed must include error checking built into the code and the developer must include routines that will deal with possible errors in execution.

Adhering to code of conduct

- A Code of Conduct is set of standards by which Software Developers agree to abide.
- many professional software developers are members of professional associations that expect adherence to a written code of conduct
- it is the responsibility

neither generating nor transmitting malware

- software developers have a responsibility to ensure their products do not contain malware
- to make sure this is the case they should check any new data and software being added to their computers for viruses
- policies should be in place to which all employees must adhere to make sure this occurs
- purchasers of software have the right to expect software they purchase is free of all malware
- software developers can be held responsible for distributing malware with their products

addressing ergonomic issues in software design

- software that performs all functions correctly is of little use if users are unable to operate the software with ease
- we should therefore analyse not only needs in terms of what the software should do, but also how users would prefer to do it
- the software must make sense to the user and should operate in a manner that integrates with their way of doing things
- task analysis is often undertaken whereby the user is observed performing different tasks and their actions are noted
- it is often useful to record other software applications that are routinely used so that consistency of design across applications can be assessed
- an intuitive user interface that allows users to work the way they want is perhaps the most critical aspect of successful software products
- some points vital to the development of consistent user interfaces include:
    - consistency of design
    - setting standards and sticking to them
    - explaining the rules
    - use interface elements correctly
    - use colour appropriately
    - use fonts appropriately
    - alignment of data entry elements
    - provide a consistent method of reversing actions
- usability is a measure of how successfully your software product meets the needs of your users
- it is not so much about the performance and functionality of the product, rather it is about the efficiency and satisfaction users experience as they use the software
- this is not easy to achieve and hence usability testing needs to be an ongoing priority throughout the development process

Ensuring software addresses inclusivity issues

- Inclusivity means not excluding people based on their cultural background, economic background, gender, disability, etc
- Inclusive software should take into account the different users who will likely use the product; as software developers, we have a responsibility to ensure software is accessible to all regardless of their culture, economics, gender or disability

cultural background

- the culture of a people can be described as the set of ways of living built up over a period of time and passed from generation to generation. Similarly, the social structure of societies is influenced by their underlying culture
- to cater for cultural differences, software developers must understand or at least be empathetic to the needs of other cultures. for example, considering:
    - western cultures have a first and surname, whereas asian cultures more commonly use a formal name and an informal name
    - the differences in the way numbers, currency, times and dates are formatted in different countries

economic background

- economic characteristics relate to the generation, distribution and use of income and wealth. this can be viewed on a global, national, local or industry specific scale
- some issues related to design and development costs, which in turn influence the final purchase price for users, include:
    - quality - the measure of how well a product meets the needs of its clients
    - nature of the market
    - management of the software design and development process

gender

- both men and women should be included in the software design and development process
- software should be designed to allow for both styles of solution
- computers generate precise scientific-type responses; this is the nature and construction of the machines
- traditionally software has been written to solve problems that do have definite answers

Licensing issues / License conditions

- there are four, commonly used classifications:
    - commercial
    - open source
    - shareware
    - public domain
- the restrictions and limitations regarding these classifications are different
- as license agreements result in a legal contract between the purchaser and the seller, it is important to have an understanding of the terminology used
- common terminology used in a license agreement include:
    - license - formal permission or authority to use a product. the license does not give users ownership of the software, rather they are granted the right to use the software
    - agreement - a mutual arrangement or contract between parties. acceptance of a software license agreement can be made in various ways. products downloaded from the internet often require clicking ‘ok’ to on-screen terms and conditions
    - term - the period of time the agreement is in force
    - warranty - an assurance of some sort - a guarantee
    - limited use - software licenses are often
    - liability
    - program
    - reverse engineer
    - backup copy
    

Pubic Domain

- software becomes public domain when the copyrights holder explicitly

Current & Emerging Technologies

- With the east at which software can be copied as a result of the internet, various techniques have been developed to combat piracy; some used presently include:
    - non-copyable data sheet
    - use of serial numbers
    - site license installation counter on a network
    - encryption key
    - registration code
    - back-to-back authentication

Non-Copyable Data Sheets

- through the 1980’s these sheets were included with some software
    - sheets contained codes the user had to enter
    - scanning technology was not widely available
    - sometimes used inks that could not be copied by photocopiers

Serial numbers

- Some hardware components of computers systems contain serial numbers
    - the software would scan this serial number and ensure that when the software was run. it would only work with the machine that had that serial number, linking the software to the machine

Site License Installation Counter on a Network

- A site license grants an organisation permission to use a certain amount of a product
    - Site License counters, determine how many machines the software has been installed on, or how many users are accessing the software at a particular point in time
    - If these licenses are exceeded, the software will not allow the distribution of installation or setup files

Encryption Key

- Encryption is the scrambling of data so it is unreadable
- An encryption key may be used to ensure that the software is only installed on the users system
- Two forms of encryption keys:
    - Symmetric - Single Key - Private Key
    - Asymmetric - Dual Key - Public and Private keys used in combination

Back to Base Authentication

- Application connects to the software publisher’s server to verify a valid licence exists
    - The software will execute only if the license is verified
    - This technique can be used either on initial installation or every time the application is run

Registration Code

- Used to activate software products during the initial stage of the installation process
    - Codes are unique for single user
    - Code is shared for network installations
    - Codes can be verified using an algorithm or over the Internet.

Forms of Privacy

- End user copying
    - individuals make copies of software or ‘lend’ to their friends
- OEM Products (Original Equipment Manufacturers)
    - Manufacturers install operating systems and other applications illegally on new machines they sell
- Counterfeiting
    - Copies of original software sold as legal software
- Mischannelling
    - Software sold with discount licences is resold as a fully licensed product
    

Use of Networks

- Networks, both on a small scale sucj as a LAN

use of networks - developer

- access to resources
    - networks allow access to pre-existing libraries of code, language tutorials
- ease of communication
    - internet allows haring of info, forums, email, online collaboration, newsgroups
- productivity
    - online collaboration, ready access to code and other resources greatly improves the productivity of software developers

use of networks - suer

- response times
    - are determined by the speed of the network being used
- interface design
    - may be slightly different to cater for multiple users accessing shared files may require a login screen
- privacy and security
    - shared files and access to a network may generate security concerns if the network is not adequate

- while generally networks may improve programmers productivity, it could also become less productive if not managed correctly
    - working on out of date modules
    - over writing new modules with older versions
    - variable use of identification
    - duplication of tasks
    

The Software Market

- Marketing
    - the effort to determine and meet the needs and wants of current and potential customers
    - to maintain market position, companies need to use a variety of strategies, and take into consideration, social and ethical issues
- The Software market is unique however standard marketing principles apply.
- The 4 ‘P’s’ of marketing can be followed

- Product - what do you sell?
- Users expectations must be realised. the program must perform the tasks that it is meant to
- the objectives must be fully understood and requirements met
- what is the demand for products in the marketplace?
- this question may determine the type of product that is produced

Place - where do u sell it?

- the physical place where a product is sold is related to the type of product and its intended audience
- examples
    - shop fronts, software retailers
- the place where a product is sold can have an effect on the perceived ethical status of the product and the expectations of potential customers

Price - what do u sell it for?

- 2 methods to determine the price of a product
- Cost Plus basis
    - take the cost of developing the product and add the profit margin
- consumer based pricing
    - look at what the consumer wants and determine how much they are prepared to pay for it
    - this method takes into considerations the users needs and tries to satisfy that need

Promotion - how do u spread the word

- promotion consists of all the ways used to persuade people to buy products and services
- promotional activities should help consumers make informed choices
- advertising activities should provide accurate information that is inoffensive and not misleading
- ‘word of mouth’ is a powerful promotion
- technique
- it is important to take into consideration customers’ needs as part of a promotional strategy

Dominant developers

- to be a dominant player in any market, your product needs to be the default purchase of consumers
    - in the software market at present, that position is generally held by Microsoft
        - Windows
        - Office
    - Recently, Apple has made significant inroads including their operation system and applications in their hardware products

Dominant developers- effect

- If one company dominates, this may have effects on the industry such as:
    - slow release of new products
    - lack of innovation
    - take over and buyout of new companies to prevent competition
    - lack of price competition

Impact of new developers

- the introduction of new ways to use software may have a profound effect on society
    - the market for software is ever increasing, especially with the increasing use of mobile and smart devices, so the opportunity for developers to have an effect
    

1.5 Legal Implications

Legal cases involving software

- the development of software can have a dramatic effect on different areas of society
- as a result of this, there have been several legal cases where copyright breaches were considered to have arisen, or software did not perform as intended or promised
- National legal action
    - RACV versus Unisys
    - NSW Tcard system
- international legal action
    - Microsoft versus Apple (GUI)
    - Microsoft versus netspace (web browser)
    - search engines (google) versus national censorship laws
    - Napster versus Metallica (file sharing)

National cases

RACV vs Unisys (1993)

- RACV (Victorian version or NRMA) made a decision to convert from a paper based claims system to an electronic system
- Unisys won the tender and promised an imaging system with response times between 2 - 4 seconds
- the system they delivered had response times between 20 - 40 seconds, which was slower than the paper based version

Tcard (Transport Card) - NSW Government vs ERG Group

- in 1996 the NSW Government requested a tcard system to be used on public transport by commuters to replace the automated ticketing system currently being used
- this system would store and hold credit that could be used by commuters when using public transport, and was hoped to be operational by the 2000 Olympic Games
- after continual delays, errors with card reading machines and lack of testing the contract was terminated in 2007
- NSW Government sought damages of $95 Million
- ERG Group counterclaimed for $200 Million

International Cases

Microsoft vs Apple (GUI)

- Apple computer released the first commercial GUI on the Macintosh personal computers
- Microsoft soon after released the first version of Windows, which was very similar to the Macintosh operation system
- Apple claimed Microsoft had stolen their idea

Microsoft vs Netscape (Browser Wars)

- in 1994, Netscape dominated the browser market with 80% share, this product was distributed free to students, teachers and researchers
- 1996 Microsoft released internet explorer 3 and gave it away for free
- 1997 Microsoft packages internet explorer 4 with Windows 95
- Netscape alleged Microsoft was taking advantage of its dominance of the Operations Systems market
- 1998 Netscape had lost most of its market share
- the US Government argued that the behaviour by Microsoft was an abuse of monopoly position and against anti competitive laws

Search Engines (Google) vs Censorship Laws

- Google China first began in 2005, but all searches were filtered and censored to comply with China’s local censorship laws
- 2009 - China blocked access to Youtube site, Google responded that they would not censor any more searches and may pull out of China
- 23/3/2010 - Google began redirecting all [google.cn](http://google.cn) searches to [google.com.hk](http://google.com.hk) its Hong Kong search engine
- 30/3/20

Napster vs Metallica

- Napster was a peer to peer file sharing utility via Internet, allowing users to upload files and have them downloaded by other users
- 1999 - The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) argued that Napster was breaching both Federal and State copyright laws
- Napster argued that is was simply a content provider and that the users were the ones breaching copyright
- Individual brand, including Metallica then sued Napster for breach of copyright

ravc vs unisys:

ravc won
